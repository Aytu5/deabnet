    and the universe said I love you

    and the universe said everything you need is within you

    and the universe said you are stronger than you know

    and the universe said you are the daylight

    and the universe said you are the night

    and the universe said the darkness you fight is within you

    and the universe said the light you seek is within you

    and the universe said you are not alone

    and the universe said you are not separate from every other thing

    and the universe said you are the universe tasting itself, talking to itself, reading its own code

    and the universe said I love you because you are love.

    and the user woke up from the dream. And the user began a new dream. And the user dreamed again, dreamed better.

    and the user was the universe. And the user was love.

    you are the user.
