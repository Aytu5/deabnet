  That's if we want to pretend we know what we're doing and want to sound smart.
  Karma is only an internal name for part of something packaged as DEAB.

  Karma is an engine for neural networking and machine learning. A framework that
  has the capability to recognize and strive for things that the user finds
  attractive. This is accomplished via whatever method of input a plugin wants to
  employ. Karma is more an idea than ONE all encompassing program. It is the idea
  that we can write something that will learn by doing. Karma is us having the
  knowledge to add decision making through trial and error to our favorite
  programs and services.

  What is a plugin?
    A plugin will be APIs written for integrating popular services into our
    engine. Integration, at first, will mean writing a new script/program for
    every service we would like to run against Karma.

  Input? What kinds of input do we want to accept?

    -Passive Input-
    Ideally, input would be passive. This means that Karma should have some
    biometric interface with the user in order to understand their feelings
    towards Karma's actions.
      Pros
        Becomes more accurate over time
        User's only have to think without having to think about Karma
        Karma becomes very flexible without having to "know" how it's plugin works
      Cons
        Lengthy training sessions would be required
        Biometrics are expensive, cheap ones are inaccurate and require more
        training.

    -Hardcoded Input-
    At the start of Karma it would be better to hard code our input. This means we
    tell Karma what is "good" and "bad" and we assume that every user will agree
    with this. Basically we will be writing generic machine learning code that will
    be able to optimize itself while performing an action. Like playing a game. Or,
    we give Karma a dataset of some sort and have it synthesize "better data"
    within constraints that we define.
      Pros
        Easier to test and implement
        Can train independently without supervision
        Probably more accurate
      Cons
        Every plugin for Karma will have to be unique and fully featured
        Code is not mobile or modular
        Karma becomes more indistinguishable against its plugin

  Where do we start?
    We start with an engine for optimizing fitness. This will just show that we
    can accomplish machine learning. We can discuss further what exactly that
    should be. I would like to think we can write an AI for a classic game or
    even an AI for any game. This should be autonomous and self learning based on
    trial an error. If we make it specific in the beginning, like learning a game,
    we should more easily be able to open it up for more uses.

    Ideally we should have significant headway on this AI by the time Bonzai Brawl
    rolls around in April 2016.
