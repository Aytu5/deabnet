    DEABnet is on Github! Talk to Tony about gaining access if you think
    you should have it.

    This allows us to collaborate on the site's design and creation without
    having to worry about syncing up files and loosing track of master
    copies.

      There are currently three branches available.
      <ul><li>master
          the obligitory master branch. Whatever is in this branch will be
          live on our (as of today not yet active) domain deabnet.com.
        </li><li>mainsite
          this branch is where we will push all of our proposed changes to the
          site. This keeps master as our "what's live" branch and mainsite as our
          "upcoming updates" branch. There isn't too much reason for this yet
          given that there are only blogposts here but when we make framework
          changes this will be a bigger deal.
        </li><li>new-tech-test
          this branch is setup for Alex. He will be building the site with ruby
          on rails, bootstrap, and all kinds of cool technologies. This will
          ultimately become a part of master as the new site but until then we
          will keep using this HTML/CSS exclusive site.</li></ul>
      This is in the Karma category because this site will be fundamental to
      Karma in the future. As it grows, so will this site. It will become a sort
      of knowledge base for us and that is important.

      This is an exciting time for us who have been plotting out DEAB since the
      beginning. It is our first tangible bit of this project but certainly not
      representative of what we hope to accomplish. Be on the lookout for cool
      developments.

      -Tony
