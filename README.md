DEAB's Home on the Internet
------------------------------
DEAbnet is our place on the internet. In the beginning DEABnet will be simple. Just posts and content. 
It has a persistent NavBar up top and a consistent theme within every category. Placeholder links to wikipedia currently exist for categories lacking our content.
Documentation exists within the HTML and CSS files but they could definitely be fleshed out more and I will be working on that some more. This website is kinda like my baby right now so I am a little defensive but there are definitely newer/better technologies to build the site on instead of plain ole HTML/CSS. Once we make some good headway on those we can merge them into the repository but until then this should serve as a decent placeholder.

Feel free to hide little easter eggs around that are unintrusive.
